# Title
**FlutterStabilityClassification**
## Problem Statement
- To try develop simple model using DNN to classify Flutter Phenomena of Airfoil NACA 64A010
- This result will be the first step and continued in next [repository](https://github.com/KukuhIksanMusyahada/Surrogate-Model-Using-DNN-and-POD)

## Results
### Raw Data

</p>

### Prediction
The accuracy of prediction is only 80%. But this result is quite good as the model precision is 83%. The model predict the flutter phenomena as a non flutter phenomena is only 4 times. This prediction have more cost than predict non flutter as a flutter. The confusion matrix also shown below.
