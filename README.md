# FlutterStabilityClassification
This repository contain a model to predict whether a given mach and flutter speed will make an airfoil NACA64A010 experienced flutter or not. The model was trained with subsonic mach region although it can be used to inference a value in transonic and supersonic, the accuracy is not guaranteed.

To try this at your local device you need to do these following steps.  
1. Clone the repository with your cmd terminal by typing  
 git clone https://github.com/KukuhIksanMusyahada/FlutterStabilityClassification.git
2. In CMD go to FlutterStabilityClassification directory 
3. Type python inference.py (make sure you have python installed or any interpreter)
